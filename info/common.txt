Docker is all about the speed and cheapness of virtualization. 

Docker CE - community edition.

Stable - one in quarter.

Any command has "--help"
$>docker container rm --help -> show you all possible variations of this command flags

Alpine - security oriented Linux distribution.

docker info - to see whole information about the things are.

Permissions to get files created for example node app container (with "node" user) by postgres container, 
we can set by chown, chmod commands. 
Command ADD/COPY in dockerfile - also has --chown flag, witch can help to manage needed permissions.
If we need to change permissions in runtime - docker-entrypoint script can help. That's the script run
everytime the container run and sets perms to needed folders. But pay attention, this script will run
under user - you've set up in dockerfile, so if you try to set perms for node container from the node user - 
you'll probably fail. Dirty hack - is that the permissions of e.g. root user (perms id) - is just a number, 
so if you know it - you can set new perm id to your node user - and it will have permissions of root.
