Docker is all about the speed and cheapness of virtualization. 

Docker CE - community edition.
Docker EE - enterprise edition.

Docker versioning:
Edge - is beta, comes out every month.
Stable - one in quarter.

Docker on Windows.
2 types of containers. Windows and Linux containers.
Concept is basically the same.
Docker for Windows -> works on Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise only. For rest - we need to install docker toolbox.
  Witch make it little less functional, and more overhead. Installation pretty simple.

Docker for Windows, to run Linux containers uses Hyper-V, it's a small Linux VM on Windows. And as you probably get it, 
only Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise has Hyper-V. For rest - we need to setup workaround, like VirtualBox.

Docker for Windows - PowerShell native. Not PowerShell ISE (Integrated Scripting Environment)
  (PowerShell.exe and PowerShell_ise.exe). ISE - gui tool, with extended functional, but as far as I get - we don't need
  it in our case.

For Win 7/8/10 Home - we need to download docker toolbox, and docker will use for Linux containers - VirtualBox.
Docker for these guys doesn't support Windows containers.
Installation: 
store.docker.com
Download docker toolbox. When you run it - it's a small installation soft. It will download small boot2docker.iso
  (with docker installed), create a VirtualBox linux machine with boot2docker.iso, and start it. So simply it's
  the same VirtualBox linux VM with docker inside, and that's the way you may play with it.
  With toolbox there a cli tool docker-machine -> powerful thing to setting and managing containers. One way to use it
  it's instead of VirtualBox gui setting the VMs hardware properties, we can set it with docker-machine, without 
  starting gui of VirtualBox.
  Docker inside VM has automatically mounted folder from Windows - C:\Users. (also called as bind map) So if you want to
  share something from the box - you can use it. It's mostly for code, do not share DB or something heavily bound to 
  OS architecture.
  If you cannot configure your shell -> $>docker-machine env default in docker toolbox, and there is a command to
    configure

Win Server 2016 - support native Windows containers. We can install Docker toolbox here too,
  but not use it for production.

For Mac
>10.10.3 - you can install docker.
<10.10.3 - you need docker toolbox
- another option, run docker in any Linux VM that you can run on your mac.
