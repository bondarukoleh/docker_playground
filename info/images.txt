$>docker pull container_name
$>docker image ls

(if there is no bash inside container)

Image is:
Simply - It's an app binaries and dependencies for your App, and metadata about image and how to run it.
Official - ordered collection of root filesystem changes and the corresponding execution parameters for 
  use within a container runtime.

So there is no real OS inside images. There no kernel, kernel modules (e.g. drivers) Because kernel is 
  provided by docker itself (it's always a tiny Linux, remember?). So there is no booting a real virtual 
  machine. There only binaries of applications that you need. Of course there are big images of ubuntu
  distribution, with their own package manager and all stuff. But still it's not a separate OS.
