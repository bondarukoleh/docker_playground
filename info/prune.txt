You can use "prune" commands to clean up images, volumes, build cache, and containers.
Examples include:
- docker image prune to clean up just "dangling" images
- docker system prune will clean up everything
- The big one is usually docker image prune -a which will remove all images you're not using.
 Use docker "system df" to see space usage.
Remember each one of those commands has options you can learn with --help.

Lastly, realize that if you're using Docker Toolbox, the Linux VM won't auto-shrink.
You'll need to delete it and re-create (make sure anything in docker containers or volumes
are backed up). You can recreate the toolbox default VM with docker-machine rm default and
then docker-machine create.

So we can remove all unused, or not needed stuff easily. Also we can use prune specific for
$>docker image prune
$>docker container prune
