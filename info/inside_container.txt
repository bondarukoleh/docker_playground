$>docker container run -it -> start new container interactively
-i, --interactive Keep STDIN open even if not attached
-t, --tty Allocate a pseudo-TTY, gives you a-like ssh command line interface, so it's like you ssh to your container

$>docker container exec -it -> run addition command to existing container.

Something you can configure just from the run command.
docker container run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]
As we can see after IMAGE (nginx, mysql ...) we have ability to pass some commands that will be executed as soon as 
  container starts.

For example docker container run -it nginx bash -> will give you a terminal inside the running container.
When you finish your work, and just exit from container bash cli -> docker stops automatically.
