So in container routing - very important thing is - naming.
Relying on IP addresses or IDs of container - it such dynamic world of docker is anti-pattern.
Docker has build-in DNS server that containers using by default to talk to each other.

Docker DNS can use container names as a "host" names to rout traffic to these containers.
So if container in one VN (and we apt-get update && apt-get install iputils-ping in them) we can:
$>docker container exec -it ng ping ng_diff_net -> and we'll see that they can talk to each other
and even more that DNS resolved container "host" by their name. 

Pay attention that default bridge VN DOESN'T have DNS. So ping by name - won't work, you should 
specify the IP of container in same Vn to ping it.
So it's much easier to create your own VN with default DNS.
To solve this situation with DNS in bridge - we can run (create) containers in bridge Vn with --link
option.
