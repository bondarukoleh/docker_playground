Creating an image with dockerfile. Dockerfile - looks like a shell script, but it's not. It's a different language.

To create image from dockerfile we need
$>docker build -f docker_file_name

Docker file commands:
FROM (required) - base distribution what you want to use for your functionality. It's debian:jessie or alpine or ubuntu. 
Many OS is provided with minimum functionality, without curls or any other stuff. So if you need some addition
packages (probably it is so), you can use apt, or yum managers, so you need distribution where they are.  
It's like: Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS. If you want have image without anything - use FROM scratch.
FROM debian:jessie

ENV - for environment variables. Putting keys and values. Order matters, it work up down.
ENV MY_EVN_VAR value
ENV MY_EVN_VAR2 'some other value'

RUN - here we can run any stuff. Also note about "&&" if you connect two commands with double-ampersand - that means
